    <h3>Poweroffer</h3>
    <p>
        This simple program idea came into my mind one day when I wasn't able to focus on my homework, cause  I was always playing youtube videos 
        in the background.

        So basicaly this program allows you to stop procrastinating on a certain website (that you choose) shutting down your pc if you will surf in to it.

        <br><br>

        Unfortunatly this program actualy works only in the Ubuntu based linux distro's but I'm working on that to expand the compatibility :)
